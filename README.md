# Client-Side Checkout Page

This is a personal project.
It's a dynamic, client-side checkout page implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to register by filling out personal data, selecting products, and submitting the form. Additionally, it features a real-time product fetch via Promises using the fetch API.
